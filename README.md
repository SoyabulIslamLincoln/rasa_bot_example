# Rasa chatbot example(The project is outdated now - older version)
This is an example rasa chatbot implementation that can be connected to your Facebook page.

## Proof of Concept
The project was a quick one week implementation to demonstrate a desired architecture of Rasa components using the latest tensforflow embeddings

Feel free to make the project your own. 

## How to start

Requirements - Docker

### First Step
Build 3 images 

```sh
cd rasa_local_settings
docker build -t rasa_local_settings .
cd ..
cd rasa_nlu_setting
docker build -t rasa_nlu_setting .
cd ..
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

### Traning
Models for NLU are not pre-trained, 

To train
```sh
docker-compose up
docker exec -it rasabotexample_rasa_nlu_setting_1 bash
python -m rasa_nlu.train --config config.yaml --data nlu/training_data.json --path nlu --project bot1
```
## Run chatbot
```sh
docker exec -it rasabotexample_rasa_core_test_1 bash
python bot.py --port 5005
